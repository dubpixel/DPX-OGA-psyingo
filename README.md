The Oscilloscope graphic artist is a project that was originally designed by Mitchell Waite in the November 1975 issue of Popular Electronics. 
I have made the design in to a PCB project with gerber files and a bill of materials for anyone to make. 
Please do not sell these for profit.
If you do a workshop please credit me, Phil Baljeu. IG @pbalpbal
